Intro
=====

The goal of this tutorial is to setup a plone project with travis.ci and test
it against plone 4.3 and plone 5.0

Continuous integration is a very powerful service to build and test your projects.
Below is an overview of the travis.ci


Travis Info
===========

Travis CI automatically detects when a commit has been made and pushed to a GitHub repository that is using Travis CI,
and each time this happens, it will try to build the project and run tests.

This includes commits to all branches, not just to the master branch.
Travis CI will also build and run pull requests. When that process has completed,
it will notify a developer in the way it has been configured to do so[ â€” for example,
by sending an email containing the test results (showing success or failure),
or by posting a message on an IRC channel.

It can be configured to run the tests on a range of different machines,
with different software installed (such as older versions of a programming language, to test for compatibility).


Step by Step Guide
==================

Note: When prompted to create a new file, do this in the root folder of your project.


Step 1
------


In the root folder of your project create a ``.travis.yml`` file.
Copy following code inside of it. The details will be explained below.

::

    language: python
    python: 2.7
    sudo: false
    env:
      - PLONE_VERSION=4.3
      - PLONE_VERSION=5.0
    matrix:
      allow_failures:
        - env: PLONE_VERSION=5.0
    before_install:
      - mkdir -p buildout-cache/downloads
      - mkdir -p buildout-cache/eggs
    install:
      - sed -ie "s#test-4.3.cfg#test-$PLONE_VERSION.cfg#" buildout.cfg
      - python bootstrap.py -c travis.cfg
      - bin/buildout -c travis.cfg annotate
      - bin/buildout -t 10 -Nc travis.cfg
    before_script:
      - "export DISPLAY=:99.0"
      - "sh -e /etc/init.d/xvfb start"
    script:
      - bin/code-analysis
      - bin/test
    after_success:
      - bin/coverage.sh
      - pip install coveralls
      - coveralls
    after_failure:
      - bin/csslint --version
      - bin/jshint --version
      - bin/jscs --version
      - firefox -v

.......

- sudo: false because otherwise the build processes take much longer


Step 2
------

Create a ``travis.cfg`` file and copy following code inside of it.
The details will be explained below.

::

    [buildout]
    extends =
        https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collective/buildout.plonetest/master/buildout-cache.cfg
        buildout.cfg
    parts =
        download
        install
        code-analysis
        coverage-sh
        createcoverage
        extras
        i18ndude
        test

    [versions]
    pep8 = >=1.5.7

    [test]
    eggs =
        bda.plone.orders[test]

    [download]
    ignore-existing = true


Step 3
------

Create a ``test-4.3.cfg`` file and copy following code inside of it.
In this file the requirements and specific version pins for plone 4.3 are configured.
The details will be explained below.

::

    [buildout]
    extends = https://raw.github.com/collective/buildout.plonetest/master/test-4.3.x.cfg
    package-name = bda.plone.orders
    package-path = ${buildout:directory}/src/bda/plone/orders
    package-extras = [test]
    #test-eggs = plone.app.contenttypes
    plone-series = 4.3

    [versions]
    plone.dexterity = 2.2.1
    plone.app.contenttypes = 1.1b1
    plone.app.event = 1.1
    plone.app.portlets = 2.5.0
    plone.app.users = 2.0.3


Step 4
------

Create a ``test-5.0.cfg`` file and copy following code inside of it.
In this file the requirements and specific version pins for plone 4.3 are configured.
The details will be explained below.

::

    [buildout]
    extends = https://raw.github.com/collective/buildout.plonetest/master/test-5.0.x.cfg
    package-name = plone.app.orders
    package-extras = [test]
    #test-eggs = plone.app.contenttypes
    plone-series = 5.0


Step 5
------

Create a ``.coveragerc`` file and copy following code inside of it.
The details will be explained below.

::

    [report]
    omit =
        /home/*/.buildout/eggs/*
        /usr/*
        bin/test
        buildout-cache/eggs/*
        eggs/*
        parts/*





Step 6
------
Ensure that your ``setup.py`` has a ``test`` section, which includes all test specific dependencies.

Step 7
------
Given the package's ``buildout.cfg`` looks something like this or
create a ``buildout.cfg`` file and copy following code inside of it.

There are some sections that will be added for different testing parts.
The details will be explained below.
